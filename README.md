# PacketLimiterQT
IP Packet Limiter that uses Token Bucket Algorithm to limit the processing speed of packets. I used [Npcap packet capture libaray](https://npcap.com/) to capture packets and interact with the network traffic. GUI is implemented using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/).

User must enter the location of pcap file that he wiches to process and the processing speed in Mbps

After processing a new window appears with the table that conatins processed packets' information
